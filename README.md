# WellTrack
ICM 24/25 Flutter Project

A mobile-first wellness journal that unites mental and physical health tracking in one seamless experience. Users can log their emotional state throughout the day, track daily steps, view weekly activity charts, and record thoughts through text, audio, photos, or videos. The app leverages native mobile functionalities like GPS, pedometer, microphone, and camera to provide accurate and real-time data. Social features allow users to connect with friends, view each otherâ€™s mood status (if shared), and discover nearby people. Designed with privacy, usability, and motivation in mind, the app acts as a personal companion to encourage a balanced and mindful lifestyle.
